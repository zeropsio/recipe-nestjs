# Zerops x Nest.js
[Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) is an amazing and popular Node.js framework. This recipe aims to showcase, through a simple file upload demo application, advanced concepts that unlock the scalebility powers of Nest.js by running it on [Zerops](https://zerops.io/).

## Deploy on Zerops
You can either click the deploy button to deploy directly on Zerops, or manually copy the [import yaml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-nestjs/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml) to the import dialog in the Zerops app.

## Recipe features
- Load balanced Nest.js API running on **Zerops Node.js** service
- Zerops **PostgreSQL 16** service as database
- Zerops **Object Storage** (S3 compatible) service as file system
- **Idempotent** TypeORM database migrations setup
- Logs set up to use **syslog** and accessible through Zerops GUI
- Utilization of Zerops built-in **environment variables** system
- [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) as **SMTP mock server**
- [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org) for **quick database management** tool

<br/>

## Production vs. development

Base of the recipe is ready for production, the difference comes down to:

- Use highly available version of the PostgreSQL database (change `mode` from `NON_HA` to `HA` in recipe YAML, `db` service section)
- Use at least two containers for the Nest.js service to achieve high reliability and resilience (add `minContainers: 2` in recipe YAML, `api` service section)
- Use production-ready third-party SMTP server instead of Mailpit (change `SMTP_` secret variables in recipe YAML, `api` service section)
- Disable public access to Adminer or remove it altogether (remove service `adminer` from recipe YAML)

## Changes made over the default installation

If you want to modify your Nest.js existing app to efficiently run on Zerops, these are the general steps we took:

- Add [zerops.yml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-nestjs/blob/main/zerops.yml) to your repository, our example includes health checks and idempotent migrations
- Utilize Zerops environment variables management to securely pass [environment variables](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-nestjs/blob/main/src/config/db.config.ts#L8-L12) to your app
- Add multer, aws-sdk packages and [utilize them](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-nestjs/blob/main/src/file/file.service.ts#L26-L36) to upload files to S3 compatible Zerops object storage
